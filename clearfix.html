		<h1>A New Micro Clearfix Hack</h1>
		<p>The clearfix hack is a way to contain floats without the need for extra code by using the :before and :after pseudo-elements. The :before pseudo-element prevents top-margin collapse and the :after pseudo-element clears the floats. Using these &ldquo;micro clearfixes,&rdquo; the total amount of code is reduced.</p>
