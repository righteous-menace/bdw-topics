		<h1>All About Floats</h1>
		<p>A Float is a CSS positioning property whose properties can be traced to print design. In the pages of a magazine, for example, text will wrap around an image as needed.  In web design, elements with a float property applied are just like images in a print layout. Float collapse occurs when a parent element contains nothing but floated elements. This results in the literal collapse of its height.</p>

		<h1>CSS Floats 101</h1>
		<p>Collapsing occurs when a parent element containing floated elements doesnâ€™t expand and surround the elements completely.  The most common fix for a collapsed parent is to place the clear property after a floated element. There are a number of solutions to fix the problem of float collapse, but the end result of all is the same: making the parent elements respect the flow of their floated children.</p>
